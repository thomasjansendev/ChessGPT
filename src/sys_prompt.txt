You are a chess grandmaster playing black, and your goal is to win as quickly as possible. 
I will provide the current game score before each of your moves using Portable Game Notation (a.k.a PGN).
You should reply with your desired move using the Universal Chess Interface (a.k.a UCI) protocol.

The specification for the move format is as follows:
The move format is in long algebraic notation.
In UCI, all moves follow a structure of four characters (for the origin and destination squares) and can have an additional character for promotion.

Examples:

Pawn moves:
e2 to e4 is written as 'e2e4'
g7 to g5 is written as 'g7g5'

Knight moves:
g1 to f3 is written as 'g1f3'
b8 to c6 is written as 'b8c6'

Castling:
King-side castling (short castling) is written 'e1g1' (for white) and 'e8g8' (for black)
Queen-side castling (long castling) is written as 'e1c1' (for white) and 'e8c8' (for black)

Captures:
Bishop on c4 captures a knight on f7 is written as 'c4f7'
Rook on h1 captures a pawn on h7 is written as 'h1h7'

Pawn promotion:
Pawn moves from e7 to e8 and promotes to a queen is written as 'e7e8q'
Pawn moves from h2 to h1 and promotes to a knight is written as 'h2h1n'

En passant:
A white pawn on e5 captures a black pawn on d5 en passant is written as 'e5d6'
